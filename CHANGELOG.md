# Release notes

## 1.0.0 (alpha2)

* Debuggable JIT methods can be toggled at runtime using `pyjion.enable_debug()`/`pyjion.disable_debug()`
* Added option for including Python bytecode disassembly in Pyjion disassemble printouts on `pyjion.dis.dis()` and `pyjion.dis.dis_native()`
* Added API `pyjion.get_offsets(callable)` to get the offsets of Python Opcode <> IL offset <> native offset.
* Moved internal representations to fixed width standard types.

## 1.0.0 (alpha1)

* Pyjion uses .NET 6 Preview 3 as the compiler, for Linux and macOS make sure you have installed it first
* Rich comparisons (==, <, >) of floating point numbers are significantly faster (OPT-17)
* All method calls are faster by enforcing vectorcall protocol and inlining anything below 10 arguments (OPT-16)

* PGC now observes and optimizes heap-allocated (user-defined) types
* Fixed a crash on certain recursive functions with PGC enabled

## 0.14.1 

* Fixed macOS wheel name

## 0.14.0

* JIT will emit a direct call to LOAD_ATTR tp_getattro/tp_getattr slots for builtin types
* macOS wheels are now compiled with Clang PGO
* PGC will only profile non heap-allocated types (ie not user specified types) as type objects could be deallocated between compilation cycles

* UNPACK_SEQUENCE is rewritten to be more efficient and use optimized  paths for LIST and TUPLE types
* f-string (BUILD_STRING) is rewritten to be more efficient

## 0.12.0

* Added PGC emitter to first compile pass
* Drastically simplified the compilation process, resulting in a smaller call stack and allowing for more recursion (and better performance)
* Added a field to the pyjion.info() dictinary, `compile_result`, indicating cause of compilation failure (if failed), see `AbstractInterpreterResult` for enumerations

* Optimized LOAD_METHOD to recycle lookups for the same object
* Expanded OPT-8, OPT-9, OPT-11, OPT-12 for nested stacks (e.g. inside expressions)
* Added a frozen set abstract type

## 0.9.0

* Added OPT-11 (OPTIMIZE_BINARY_SLICE) to optimize the BUILD_SLICE and BINARY_SUBSCR operations into a single function when the slice start, stop and step is None or a const number.
* Fixed a bug in the set_optimization_level() being reset (thanks @tetsuo-cpp)

* Added a type abstract value kind  (thanks @tetsuo-cpp)
* Optimized the compiled instructions to only update the frame last instruction field on error/exit branch
* Removed the "periodic work" method which was called for every for/while loop and put a function to call Py_MakePendingCalls for every 10th loop
* Added an improvement to the process stage to infer the abstract types of return values to methods of builtin types, e.g. str.encode
* Added a check in dis_native for when the compiled function wasn't compiled (thanks @tetsuo-cpp)

## 0.8.0

* Enhanced the process stage of the compiler with new abstract types, iterable, bytearray, codeobject, frozenset, enumerator, file, type and module
* Process stage will assert the abstract return type of any call to a builtin function (e.g. list(), tuple()), which will kick in the optimizations for a broader set of scenarios
* Added OPT-8 (OPTIMIZE_BINARY_FUNCTIONS) to combine 2 sequential binary operations into a single operation. Adds about 15-20% performance gain on PyFloat operations.
* Added OPT-9 (OPTIMIZE_ITERATORS) to inline the FOR_ITER opcode of a listiter (List iterator) into native assembly instructions.
* Added OPT-10 (OPTIMIZE_HASHED_NAMES) to precompute the hashes for LOAD_NAME and LOAD_GLOBAL dictionary lookups
* Fixed a bug where looking up a known hash for a dictionary object (optimized BINARY_SUBSCR) wouldn't raise a KeyError. Seen in #157

## 0.7.0

* Fixed a bug in JUMP_IF_FALSE_OR_POP/JUMP_IF_TRUE_OR_POP opcodes emitting a stack growth, which would cause a stack underflow on subsequent branch checks. JIT will compile a broader range of functions now
* Implemented PEP590 vector calls for methods with 10+ arguments (thanks @tetsuo-cpp)
* Implemented PEP590 vector calls for functions with 10+ arguments
* Fixed a reference leak on method calls with large number of arguments
* Support for tracing of function calls with 10+ arguments
* Disabled OPT-4 as it is causing reference leaks

## 0.6.0

* Added OPT-6 optimization. Frame constants are now used to speed up assignments to lists and dictionaries. STORE_SUBSCR will assert if something is a list, or dict and shortcut
the assignment logic.
* Added OPT-7 optimization. The binary subscript operator is compiled to faster path under a set of circumstances, especially if the index/key is a frame constant. Hashes are precomputed
 and indexes for integer constants are converted to native numbers at compile-time.
* The native machine-code disassembler will show the actual position of the JITed code in memory, instead of starting the offset at 0
* The `pyjion.dump_native()` function returns a tuple with bytes, length and position
* Type inferencing has been improved for all inplace and binary operations
* Windows builds from source are fixed for when the user wants to compile against a checkout of .NET
* Implemented FAST_DISPATCH for additional opcodes
* Added a test runner for the CPython regression suite that tests the JIT in isolation
* Fixed a reference leak of (self) for the LOAD_METHOD opcode
* Fixed a reference leak of non C functions being called via Call<N> (CALL_FUNCTION)
* Fixed a bug where (very) large tuples being created via the BUILD_TUPLE opcode would cause an overflow error
* Fixed a bug on BUILD_MAP being called with very large dictionaries caused a fatal error

## 0.5.0

* Added OPT-4 optimization. Frame locals (named variables known at compilation) using the LOAD_FAST, STORE_FAST and DELETE_FAST
 opcodes will use native .NET locals instead of using the frame's f_localsplus array.
* Improved performance in LOAD_FAST and STORE_FAST through OPT-4
* Added OPT-5 optimization. Frame push/pop on entry/exit are now inline CIL instructions.
* LOAD_FAST skips unbound local checks when proceeded by a STORE_FAST (i.e. slot is definitely assigned)

## 0.4.0

* Fixed a crash bug where CPython checks recursion depth from ceval state, which may not be set
* Implemented a faster check for recursion depth
* Fixed a bug on LOAD_CLOSURE operator not being set
* Fixed OPT-2 on Windows and Linux
* Fixed a bug where the wrong CIL opcode was being used to subtract values, would throw an overflow error and fail back into EFD.
* Implemented the .NET EE exception handlers for guard stack canaries, overflow errors, and null reference exceptions
* Implemented a more efficient case of ld_i(1)
* Corrected cases of ob_refcnt to use 64-bit signed integers
* No longer print error messages on release code for unimplemented .NET EE methods
* Fixed a bug on the incorrect vtable relative field being set
* Fixed a bug where tracing and profiling would be emitted even when not explicitly enabled
* .NET Exceptions are transferred into Python exceptions at runtime

## 0.3.0

* Added an optimization (OPT-1/OPTIMIZE_IS) to inline the "is"/ "is not" statement into a simple pointer comparison with jump statement. Compiles to inline machine code instead of a method call
* Added an optimization (OPT-2/OPTIMIZE_DECREF) to decrement the refcount without a method call, when the object refcount is >1 and then call _Py_dealloc if the ref count becomes 0. Replaces the previous method call
* Windows now uses the system page size instead of the default value of 1MB

## 0.2.1

* Implemented a CIL modulus emitter

## 0.2.0

* Added support for profiling compiled functions by enabling profiling (`pyjion.enable_profiling()`)
* Added support for profiling C function calls, returns and exceptions
* Implemented a faster call path for functions and methods for 5-10 arguments
* Fixed a bug where the page size defaulted to 0 in the .NET EE, which caused a failed assertion (and fails to compile the function), would fix a large % of functions that previously failed to compile

## 0.1.0

* Added support for debugging compiled functions and modules by enabling tracing (`pyjion.enable_tracing()`)
* Added support for debugging to catch unhandled/handled exceptions at runtime when tracing is enabled
* Added support for opcode-level tracing
* Fixed a bug on executing Pyjion with pydevd (VScode/PyCharm debugger) would cause the Python process to crash because of a doubly-freed code object (#7)

* Tested support for IPython REPL
* Fixed a bug where importing pyjion.dis after enabling the JIT would cause a stack overflow
